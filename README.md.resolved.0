# Offline Neural TTS Application

A standalone Linux desktop application to convert text to speech using high-quality neural models (Coqui TTS) completely offline.

## Features
- **Offline Generation**: No internet required after initial model download.
- **Neural Quality**: Uses the VITS model (VCTK dataset) for natural-sounding speech.
- **Multi-Speaker**: Choose from over 100 different voices (Male/Female/Various accents).
- **Save Audio**: Export speech to `.wav` files.

## Prerequisites
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- **Python**: 3.9+ (Recommended)
- **System Libraries**: `espeak-ng` (often required by TTS engines)
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
  ```

## Installation

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended to avoid conflicts):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv tts_env
    source tts_env/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: This will download PyTorch and Coqui TTS, which may take some time (~700MB+).*

## Running the Application

1.  **Launch**:
    ```bash
    python3 tts_app.py
    ```

2.  **First Run**:
    - The application will automatically download the default model (`tts_models/en/vctk/vits`) during the "Initializing Worker..." phase.
    - **Wait** for the status bar to show "Ready. Model Loaded.". This depends on your internet speed and only happens once.

3.  **Usage**:
    - **Select Voice**: Use the dropdown to pick a speaker (e.g., `p226` for male, `p225` for female).
    - **Type Text**: Enter text in the box.
    - **Play**: Click "Generate & Play" to hear it immediately.
    - **Save**: Click "Save to File" to archive the audio.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Audio**: Ensure `sounddevice` and `portaudio` are installed.
  - Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio portaudio19-dev` might be needed if pip install fails.
- **Slow Generation**: Neural TTS is heavy. A dedicated GPU (NVIDIA) speeds it up significantly, but modern CPUs can run VITS in near real-time.
